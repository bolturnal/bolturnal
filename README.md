## So what happens now?

**Let's run through my options again:**
Coffee... but I don't wanna make it...
Watch a [Movie](https://letterboxd.com/theBoltMan)? but I've got _exams_.
I need to study for 'em... but I'm tired.
Maybe I should torture myself and make that coffee.

And the coffee sucks. Anyways... wait... where was I? Oh right. I have to study.
But caffeine takes about 30 minutes to work. I should write today's _journal--shuttle_ then.

1400 words. I'm feeling more confused than before.
Let's do a quick check on socials.
Or... check texts. I know I've got nothing.
